For your first challenge, start by deleting my name out of the sentence below
and replacing it with yours. Then create a new line using the commands we learned
and tell me what operating system you are using. Then start a new line while in insert
mode and write what your favorite programming language is. When you are finished. Save and exit
the file.
************************************************************************************
Here are the basic commands that we've covered in this chapter to help you out.
        i - insert (this allows you to write text. When you're finished, press ESC
		   to exit insert mode)
        h,j,k,l - This allows you to navigate around the document. (The arrow keys
                  are just as acceptable too!)
        x - delete text
        o - create a new line to insert into
        u - undo
        crtl-R -redo
        zz - saves your work and quits
