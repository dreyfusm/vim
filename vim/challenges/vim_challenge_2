For this challenge, you're going to create a .vimrc file in your home directory. Creating this
configuration file will allow you to set configurations and customizations for your editor 
everytime you open a browser. For our situation, lets add the following lines to our .vimrc file.

syntax on
set number

When you are done. Save the file. You will notice that if you try to run "ls", you will not see
the file. This is because the '.' lets bash know that it's a configuration file and to not 
display it. To see your file, run 'ls -a'. I have included a sample file that you can use to
compare or use.
