For your first challenge, start by deleting my name out of the sentence below
and replacing it with yours. Then create a new line using the commands we learned
and tell me what operating system you are using. When you are finished. Save the file.
Remember here are the basic commands that we've covered in this chapter
        i - insert (this allows you to write text. When you're done press ESC)
        h,j,k,l - This allows you to navigate around the document. (The arrow keys
                  are just as acceptable too!)
        x - delete text
        o - create a new line to insert into
        u - undo
        crtl-R -redo
        zz - saves your work and quits
